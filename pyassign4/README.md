# Notice

Sometimes the result given by this program is a bit larger than the standard answer given by prof. Cao,
that's because this program considered some special situations.

Take the word ***'you'*** as example: **my_ans == 173**, **std_ans == 171**.
That's because ***'--you'*** and ***'you--'*** appear one time each in the article, and this program take them into consideration.
