# Notice

### In this file folder, there're 2 python scripts.

- *The one named 'currency.py' uses the function eval, so the code is short and simple.*
- *The other one named 'currency_sub.py' follows [the instruction of Cornell](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1110/2016fa/assignments/assignment1/index.php#iterative).*

**Please choose the one accorded with the requirement.**
