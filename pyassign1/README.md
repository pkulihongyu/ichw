# Notice

### In this file folder, there're 2 python scripts.

- *The one named 'planets.py' uses not only normal functions but also classes to keep the code neat and clean.*
- *The other one named 'planets_sub.py' only uses normal functions, whose logic, in my opinion, is not as neat as the first one.*

**Please choose the one accorded with the requirement.**
